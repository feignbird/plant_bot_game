## PlantBot is just a prototype game created with the inspiration from light bot. It is text-based 2d runnable program with 4 key functions (fwd(), r_cw(), r_ccw(), plant()). The major gloal is to plant all red squares with minimun numbers of lines of code using python.

### To run this program, You don't need interpreter, just goto [pyground.feignbird.live](https://pyground.feignbird.live) & then copy all of the code in plant_bot.py & paste it in the empty editor of pyground then hit 'play' button. Tada!! ... Now you can play the game or even make your own using pyground.
